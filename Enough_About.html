    <h1> The Mission </h1>
    <p class="par"> &emsp;&emsp;A year ago, I teamed up with High Kick Self-Defense to create a queer-specific self-defense series called ENOUGH: You are enough. We’ve had enough.
      Over 100 interviews were conducted by program director Rae Switlick to create classes that queer people felt comfortable attending and would teach self-defense
      for scenarios that are particular to us. With a greater confidence in our ability to protect ourselves, we can strut through life with the focus and empowerment to accomplish our dreams.
      As a victim of physical assault myself and with the alarming increase in violence against queer people, I believe it’s absolutely necessary that we all know how to protect ourselves and others around us.
      That is why Rae and I are extremely driven to get ENOUGH back on its feet and made more accessible to everyone.
      Our goal is to provide free self-defense classes at rotating queer venues around the city.</p> <br>
    <h1> The Creators </h1>
    <h3 class="par"> Founder / Head Instructor: Rae Switlick</h3>

    <p class="par"> &emsp;&emsp;Rae’s strongest held belief is that every individual should be provided with the agency and access to live a fulfilled
            life as they so choose. Rae has been teaching physical self-defense practices for several years, currently serving
            private clients through her llc, HighKick, and as the Program Manager for Empowerment Self Defense at the
            Center for Anti-Violence Education. In addition to her training and certification as a Krav Maga instructor, her
            fighting background also includes practice in Muay Thai, Brazilian jujitsu, kickboxing, boxing, and an undefeated
            amateur fight record. She provides a holistic approach to self-defense, supported by her sociological research for
            her MA in Performance & Culture at Goldsmiths, University of London and her ongoing support of social justice
            efforts, particularly in relation to the performing arts and at-risk communities. Rae holds two additional degrees
            from The Ohio State University: a BFA in Dance and a BA in English, and has experience working with a range of
            special populations, ages, and demographics. </p>

    <p class="par"> &emsp;&emsp;I'm from the middle of nowhere Ohio, where I was intensely bullied. My voice was too high, my mannerisms too feminine,
        and my love for gymnastics, cheer, art, and dance was not what Midwest boys were supposed to love. I could feel so many people trying to dim my light,
        but I knew I was capable of shining bright. So straight out of college, I moved to NYC not only to pursue my dream of being a professional performer but to find a community
        of people who would love me for who I am, even if they didn't fully understand me. But what I found was so much more than that. I found the most diverse, interesting,
        curious, driven, powerful, passionate, connected, and surprising spectrum of colorful people to ever exist.
        These people embraced me and gave me the strength and courage to attack my life with love at the helm.

        My mantra is, “Be Silly, Be Kind, Be Grateful,” and I work very hard to enter every situation reminding myself of that.
        And when I do, things just work out better. I have a better time, and I realize how precious life is.
        I’m able to connect with more people, and I can see them relax and light up and that makes me feel amazing!
        It quickly became my core motivator to give everyone around me what they need to thrive and light up the world with their talent and love.
        We all have it in us, and I genuinely believe in the goodness in people.</p>

      <p class="par"> &emsp;&emsp;I've been in NYC for 10 years, working hard as hell. I’ve had some crazy experiences and I’ve learned a whole lot.
        I’ve trained, auditioned like crazy, and worked as a professional dancer. I created a fitness career through group and personal
        training and created a queer-empowering fitness event called Werkout. I’ve traveled the country choreographing and inspiring high school
        cheer squads and show choirs, produced several cheer camps, and created a performance arts education program and competition called Own It.
        I was the Director of Advocacy for Impulse Group NYC and produced several charity and fundraising events. Most recently, I co-created and
        choreographed the national tour for globally loved drag artist Alaska 5000. With all this experience and knowledge, I am finally able to
        confidently attack this dream of uplifting love, diversity, and those around me who need a hand by harnessing my talents, resources, and skill sets.</p>
